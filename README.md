# Sokoban Game

This is a project I did uring my course at university.
This is a Python implementation of the classic game Sokoban. The game is built using Flask for the backend and MongoDB for data storage.

The repo has a pitch pdf file and some docker stuff also used to finish my project in the university course, which had basic docker deploy and a business pitch for the app.

## Features

- Level progression
- Leaderboard functionality 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

bash: git clone https://github.com/linhbuitung/sokoban.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

bash: pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the application:
bash: python app.py


## Usage

The game starts by asking for the player's name. The player can then navigate through the levels. The player's progress is stored by choice and can be viewed on the leaderboard.
